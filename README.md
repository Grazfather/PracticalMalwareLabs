# Practical Malware Labs

This project is only to track my progress with the labs included in the book [*Practical Malware Analysis*](http://www.nostarch.com/malware).

The malware binaries are available [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/labs-encryptzip/) (password: 'malware').

There is a more-or-less complete writeup for each and every lab in the book. They aren't, in general, better than the writeups included in the book (except in a few cases where I think I did a better job scripting something), but I think they show a pretty good progression of my malware analysis skills.
