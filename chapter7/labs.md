# Chapter 7 labs
## Lab 7-1
### Basic Static Analysis
- strings: A few errors: "runtime error", "TLOSS error", "SING error", and "DOMAIN error", some messages that start with "- " that seem related to memory ("- unable to initialize heap"). "HDL345", "MalService" and "Malservice", "http://www.malwareanalysisbook.com" and "Internet Explorer 8.0" all are suspicious as well.
- PEiD: Unpacked, Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0.
- Dependency Walker: Imports from KERNEL32.LL including to create threads, mutexes, get/free environment strings, and 'TerminateProcess' all seem suspect. From ADVAPI32.LL it imports 'CreateServiceA', 'OpenSCManagerA', and 'SatartServiceCtrlDispatcherA' which suggests it installs this malware as a service (especially considering we see "MalService" with strings above). From WININET.DLL it imports 'InternetOpenA' and 'InternetOpenUrlA'.
- PEview: Normal section names and headers.

### Basic Dynamic Analysis
Set up fakedns, netcat on port 80, regshot and procmon, then ran the malware from the shell. We see a DNS request for www.malwareanalysisbook.com as expected as well as an http request with the user-name set to "Internet Explorer 8.0" and Cache-Control set to "no-cache". The application seems to continue to run. In regshot we see that a service called "Malservice" has been installed. In procmon we see the registry writes for the new service and a bunch of different threads started. The service is installed with the original exe, so it doesn't appear a copy was made. After advanced static analysis I am not sure why we got this far: I expected the http requests and threads being created would not start until 2100.

### Advanced Static Analysis
Right when this application begins it called 'StartServiceCtrlDispatcherA' with the _lpServiceName_ as "MalService" and the lpServiceProc sub_401040. It then calls this sub_401040. This sub_401040 attempts to open a mutex calls "HGL345" if it succeeds it closes, otherwise it proceeds to create a mutex with this name, and then connect to the service control manager using 'OpenSCManagerA'. It then calls 'GetCurrentProcess' and then 'GetModuleFileNameA' with a NULL _hModule_ argument to get the filename of the malware. With this information is forms the arguments to 'CreateServiceA' which it calls next. It sets the _dwServiceType_ to "SERVICE_WIN32_OWN_PROCESS" and the _dwStartType_ to "SERVICE_BOOT_START", so we know it expects to run on every boot. It then appears to create a timer with all fields except the year set to 0, and the year set to 2100 (January 1, 2100) and calls 'WaitForSingleObject' to wait until this time. Once January 1, 2100 hits it then creates 20 new threads in a loop, each starting at the function 'StartAddress'. This function is what makes the connection attempt to "www.malwareanalysisbook.com" in a loop with no delay. Once 20 threads have been created sub_401040 sleeps for 0xFFFFFFFF milliseconds before returning.

### Questions
1. This program is able to resume after the computer is restarted because it installs itself as a service named "MalService".
2. The program uses a mutex presumably to make sure there is only one instance of itself running on the system at a time.
3. A good host-based signature would be the name of the service this program tries to register itself as as well as the name of the mutex it creates.
4. A good network-based signature would probably be the URL it requests as well as the user-agent it uses for its requests.
5. The purpose of this program is to spawn many threads and then spamm requests to "www.practicalmalwarebook.com", probably for DDoS pruposes. It is like some of the malware I have already seen but it in more advanced in that it spawns multiple threads and it achieves persistence through use of Windows Services.
6. This program will finish executing about 4 billion milliseconds, or about 46 days after January 1, 2100.
