## Lab 15-1
### Basic Static Analysis
- **strings**: "Good Job!", "Son, I am disappoint.".
- **PEiD**: Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0.
- **Dependency Walker**: _very_ few imports. `printf`, `exit`, and a few others from _MSVCRT.DLL_.
- **PEview**: Normal section names and headers.

### Basic Dynamic Analysis
This program is _very_ simple. Procmon shows almost nothing, and the only output I could get was "Son, I am disappoint." whether or not I supplied input.

### Advanced Dynamic/Static Analysis
In IDA it's easy to see how simple this application is, but that could be deceptive. `_main` cannot be shown in graph mode, and there are many calls to what are probably actuall instructions. We see the `jmp <loc>+1` and can fix them by pressing `D` on the location, moving down a byte, and then pressing `C` to turn it back to code. There are cases where soon after a new code segment IDA interprets more raw data, but these can be fixed again with `C`. OllyDBG actually does an impressive job of figuring out which instructions to disassemble, but isn't needed for this simple lab. Although IDA doesn't show the arguments to `_main` correctly, this can be fixed by selecting the function from the prologue to the return and then pressing `P`. Now it's simple enough to see that they are accessing _argc_ with `[epb+8]` and comparing it to 2, and then getting the first string _argv[1]_. After this, it's simple single byte comparisons, done out of order. First it checks that the first byte is 'p', then that the third is 'q', and finally that the second is 'd'. Sure enough, running the executable with "pdq" as the argument prints out "Good Job!". Since there are no extra checks, you can tack on anything else after that first argument, but because _argc_ is tested to be exactly 2, you cannot add distinct new args.

### Questions
1. This executable uses the technique of using a condition jump with a constant condition.
2. The 'E8' opcode, which corresponds to `call` is the single byte that the executable tricks IDA into disassembling.
3. This technique is used five times in `_main`.
4. Passing the executable a single argument that starts with "pdq" will print out "Good Job!".
